- implement the update channel message for fees and lock delta
- set a proper gossip propagation policy (stop after hops? periodically broadcast from thread?)

- channel confirmation delay, also similar blockchain related events
- importing real topology (e.g. lncli describegraph)
- saving state
- restart uvm network (DONE)
- profiles in properties
- deterministic random in nodes:

warmup, but in general, starting time of bootstrap creates a race condition on which p2p message will be received
for example: node x opens a channel, announce to peers, but peers that opened the channel towwards x will be
in the list only if their channel has been opened from their side, which depend on bootstrap timing
- the list of channel should not depend on this, for each channel

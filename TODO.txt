- interfaces for UVNode and edges, exposing the right data on graphs
- implement the update channel message for fees and lock delta
- set a proper gossip propagation policy (stop after hops? periodically broadcast from thread?)

- channel confirmation delay, also similar blockchain related events
- importing real topology (e.g. lncli describegraph)
- saving state

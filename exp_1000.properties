#GENERAL SETTINGS

# enable special debub() logging function for further messsages
# notice: on big networks this can affect the performance
debug=false
# output log file. Be sure to check the size for excessive increase when using debug
logfile=1000.log
# seed for simulation. Please notice that since thread specific random generators are used,
# this value does not guarantee determininistic behavior (e.g. replicable sims)
seed=1

#BOOTSTRAP SETTINGS
#Used when bootstrapping a network from scratch,e.g. instead of loading a
# pre-existing topology (e.g., lncli describegraph)

#range of initial blocks during while each node can be bootstrapped
bootstrap_warmup=60

#number of nodes to be bootstrapped
bootstrap_nodes=1000

#range of initial onchain funding
bootstrap_min_funding=10000000
bootstrap_max_funding=20000000

#number of channels each node tries to open when bootstrapping
bootstrap_min_channels=5
bootstrap_max_channels=20

# sizes of the channels opened
bootstrap_min_channel_size=1000000
bootstrap_max_channel_size=5000000

# LN settings ############################################################
to_self_delay=20
#number of confirmation to assume channel funding confirmed

##########################################################################
#P2P SETTINGS

# how many times each messages can be forwarded
p2p_max_hops=3
# age time - number of blocks after which messages are considered old
p2p_max_age=5

# max number of p2p gossip messages processed at each p2p call
gossip_flush_size=500

# REALT-TIME settings ####################################################
# This parameters does not represent the timing in the real-world, but affect how timechain related events
# are mapped into thread simulation events. Two aspects to be considered:
# 1) While they don't directly change the behavior of the nodes, they could impact the simulation performance
# 2) They should ALWAYS be modified and considered in coherence with eath other. E.g., if you reduce the blocktime to make a "faster" sim,
# but leave the p2p period unchanged, it's like indirectly choosing of having less of the periodic p2p method calls

# blocktime (msec) used during simulation
blocktime=1000
# time (msec) related to periodic actions performed on p2p network (gossip etc..)
#"SHOULD flush outgoing gossip messages once every 60 seconds"
# according to BOLT suggestion, this should be around 1/10 of blocktime. See "rebroadcasting" here:
# https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/07-routing-gossip.md#initial-sync
p2p_period=100
